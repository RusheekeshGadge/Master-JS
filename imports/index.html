        //we cannot import wirhout the type module
        //script.js should be in the same directory as index.html
        //script.js should contain export const addition = (a, b) => a + b;

        //we cannot import the files if the http file is not running on the server


        //we can import the function like {addition as add}
        //and can use as like add(3,7)


        //import with an alias
        //we can also export file from javascript like export{addition as sum}
        //and we can import as {sum}
        import {addition} from './script.js';
        console.log(addition(5, 3));

        //import all named exports
        //import * as all from './script.js';
        //console.log(all.addition(5, 3));
        //but the modules we are not using but imported gets deleted
        //so it is not a good practice to import all named exports
        //thats called tree shaking

        //import default 
        // import addition from './script.js';
        //in the defaukt export import only one file has one module
        //that can be increases the number of files
        //import sum from './script.js'
        //it will work perfectly fine even if we didnt export as sum because the file has only one module 
        //and you can make file without function name also
